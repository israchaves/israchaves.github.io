I'm a researcher in the fields of robotic manipulators and collaborative robots, at the [Autonomous Robots and Cognitive Systems Lab ARCOS-Lab](https://wiki.arcoslab.org). ðŸ¤–

Currently working towards my Master's Thesis in Computer Science implementing capability maps for object manipulation with humanoid robots. ðŸ¦¾

I am also a junior lecturer at [Mechanical Engineering Department](https://eim.ucr.ac.cr), at the University of Costa Rica, teaching courses about electronics, mechatronics and technical drawing. ðŸ“š

In this site, I keep my lectures, a list of my publications, and some other resources that I use to teach different topics about hardware and software.
