    <p>Through this page, you can automatically reserve a virtual consultation space to answer any questions you may have. The page shows the available times, to book a virtual meeting by Zoom, to make your questions. By default, the meeting takes 30 minutes, if you require more time, please indicate this in a question that will appear later. You can book meetings at least 4 hours in advance, and cancel or reschedule the meeting at any time.</p>
